This is based off of two tutorials to teach me Spring. It is being morphed into a more in-depth back end for a future website, iOS app, and Android app. It is a bit of a dog's breakfast at the moment though. However, that means it can only get better!

Tutorial 1: http://www.codejava.net/frameworks/spring/spring-mvc-with-jdbctemplate-example

Tutorial 2: http://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/
